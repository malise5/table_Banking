# Loan Management System

## Overview
The Loan Management System is designed to allow users to register, contribute monthly, and apply for loans. The system calculates loan eligibility and applies interest based on the loan type. Loans can either have compound or simple interest, and interest starts accruing immediately upon issuance. This system ensures users cannot skip monthly contributions if they wish to qualify for a loan.

## Features

### Functional Features
- **User Registration:** Users can register and create an account to interact with the system.
- **Monthly Contributions:** Users are required to contribute every month. Skipping a month will make them ineligible for a loan.
- **Loan Application:** Users can apply for a loan, which will accrue interest from the day it is issued.
- **Interest Calculation:** Loan interest can be calculated using either compound or simple interest. The system defines which type is used.
- **Loan Eligibility:** The system automatically determines the eligibility for a loan based on the user's monthly contributions and other criteria.

### Technical Features
- **Spring Boot 3.x** for building the backend of the application.
- **Java 17+** for modern and efficient development.
- **Spring Data JPA** integrated with **PostgreSQL** for data persistence and query operations.
- **Lombok** used to reduce boilerplate code (such as getters, setters, constructors).
- **Spring Boot DevTools** to enable auto-restart during development, improving development speed.
- **Spring Boot Testing** using **JUnit** and **Mockito** for unit and integration testing.
- **Postman** for API testing to ensure all endpoints work as expected.

## System Requirements
- **Java 17+** (Ensure Java 17 or higher is installed)
- **PostgreSQL** (Make sure a PostgreSQL instance is running and accessible)
- **Maven** or **Gradle** (for building and managing dependencies)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### 2. Configure the Database
- Install and configure PostgreSQL on your local machine or use a remote database.
- Update `application.properties` or `application.yml` with your PostgreSQL database connection details:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/loan_system
spring.datasource.username=your-db-username
spring.datasource.password=your-db-password
```

### 3. Build the Project
To build the project, use the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### 4. Run the Application
Run the Spring Boot application using:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Alternatively, you can run the project directly from your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

### 5. Test the APIs
Use **Postman** to test the exposed APIs. Import the provided Postman collection or create your own tests for the following:

- **User Registration:** POST `/api/users/register`
- **Monthly Contribution:** POST `/api/contributions`
- **Loan Application:** POST `/api/loans/apply`
- **Loan Eligibility Check:** GET `/api/loans/eligibility`

## API Endpoints

### 1. **POST /api/users/register**
- Registers a new user in the system.
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "username": "john_doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "password": "securepassword123"
  }
  ```
- **Response:**
  - `200 OK` if successful.
  - `400 Bad Request` for invalid input.

### 2. **POST /api/contributions**
- Allows a user to make a monthly contribution.
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "userId": 1,
    "amount": 100
  }
  ```
- **Response:**
  - `200 OK` if successful.
  - `400 Bad Request` for invalid contribution.

### 3. **POST /api/loans/apply**
- User can apply for a loan based on their contributions.
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "userId": 1,
    "loanAmount": 5000,
    "interestType": "compound"
  }
  ```
- **Response:**
  - `200 OK` if successful.
  - `400 Bad Request` if the user is ineligible.

### 4. **GET /api/loans/eligibility**
- Checks if the user is eligible for a loan.
- **Request Params:**
  - `userId`: User's ID.
- **Response:**
  - `200 OK` with eligibility status.
  - `400 Bad Request` for invalid user ID.

## Development

### Local Development Setup
Ensure you have the following tools installed:
- **Java 17+**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Maven** or **Gradle**
- **IDE (Optional)**: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VSCode

### Running Tests
To run unit tests, use the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn test
```

### Testing APIs
Use **Postman** to send requests to the endpoints described above.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot 3.x**
- **Java 17+**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Lombok**
- **JUnit & Mockito** (for testing)
